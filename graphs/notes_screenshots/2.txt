so in adjaceny matrix , just choose rows first then choose columns next , and if there is connection 
add one if there is no connection add 0.
 if the connection has weight/cost put that instead of one.
same in adjaceny list, choose row and keep adding nodes for the connections respectively.

in compact list, see diagram
connections are filled in order starting from one vertice to other vertices. then starting index of this vertices are filed in 
the first positions representing vertices. there is a space between vertices and connections usme out of array ka index bahrte hai
